## Uses
I use this with my phone so that way I can set my phone on my laptop and unlock it (when my phone is unlocked of course), I recommend using this with Tailscale to provide consistent access and security

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/ToasterWithTheBread/UbuntuUnlock
cd UbuntuUnlock
sudo nano .env
```

Now is when you should change the enviroment variables to make the service more secure

```
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
